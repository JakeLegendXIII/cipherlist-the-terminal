6x6 Matrix Puzzle Game

Based on breach protocol style matrix puzzles. The goal is to select values from a 6x6 matrix that most optimally complete the keys on the right. The player is awarded points based on the complexity of the sequence they are able to select in the matrix and get it into the limited number of spaces in the buffer. 

Game modes:
* Free play mode where you can just solve the puzzles for fun or practice.
* Timed mode where you are given only 60 seconds per puzzle and there are a total of 10 puzzles.
* Timed mode where you get as many points as possible in 5 minutes.

Synthwave soundtrack (songs by me):
* Losing Light
* Around
* Neon Thump
