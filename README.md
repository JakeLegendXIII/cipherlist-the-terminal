Puzzle Game

Based on the breach protocol style matrix puzzles. The goal is to select values from a 6x6 matrix that most optimally complete the values on the right. The player is awarded points based on the complexity of the sequence they are able to select in the matrix and get it into the limited number of spaces in the buffer. 

Planned game modes:
* Free play mode where you can just solve the puzzles for fun or practice.
* Timed mode where you are given only 60 seconds per puzzle.
* Timed mode where you get as many points as possible in 3-5minutes.
